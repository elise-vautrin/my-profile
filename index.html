			<p>
				In life, what I prefer above all is sharing moments with my friends and family. I also love sports and arts very much, without forgetting coding of course! 2nd year student at l'IESEG Paris, I would like to make the luxury industry an integral part of my career.

			<h2>Friends and family👨‍👩‍👧‍👦</h2>
			<p>
				Family and friends are what matter the most to me. I love spending time with them, laughing and creating memories. They are the one that will always be there for me, in good and bad times, that's why I attach so much importance to them.

			<h2>Sports🏋</h2>
			<p>
				I have always love sports, whether it is watching or doing it, it makes me feel good and relaxed. There are lots of sports I love and used to do, such as boxing, running, skiing and crossfit. I try to play sports at least three times a week, it allows me to escape and think of nothing for a few hours.

			<h2>Arts🎨</h2>
			<p>
				My mother has always love arts and she transmitted this passion to me. I am fond of music, cinema, paint and photography (I am absolutely amazed by the work of Peter Lindbergh). I'm also hugely interested in fashion and haute couture, and I like to believe that this can also be considered a kind of art.
